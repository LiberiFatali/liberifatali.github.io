  <strong>Rain</strong>
  <br><br>
  Woke up this morning with<br>
  a terrific urge to lie in bed all day<br>
  and read. Fought against it for a minute.
  <br><br>
  Then looked out the window at the rain.<br>  
  And gave over. Put myself entirely<br>  
  in the keep of this rainy morning.
  <br><br>
  Would I live my life over again?<br>
  Make the same unforgiveable mistakes?<br>
  Yes, given half a chance. Yes.
